## 🎮 What Is a Fortnite Skinchanger?

A skinchanger is a cosmetic mod tool that **swaps your character’s appearance** in-game. It modifies memory or game assets to trick your client into loading **any cosmetic item** – skins, backblings, pickaxes, gliders, wraps, even emotes.

✅ *Visual only* (no gameplay advantage = lower ban risk)
✅ Works in real matches, lobbies, and replays
✅ Can apply entire combos: skin + emote + glider in one click
✅ Invisible to other players (unless you're using private builds 👀)

## ⚠️ Risk Warning

Skinchangers are **mostly safe**, but they **can still trigger flags** if done wrong:

* ❌ Don't use in tournaments
* ❌ Don't combine with other memory-based hacks
* ✅ Stick to visuals-only builds
* ✅ Use alt accounts for testing
* ✅ Always scan files for malware from shady sources

Use with chill energy, and you’ll likely fly under the radar. But pushing private builds into ranked? That’s on you.
